# Mean Field and Refined Mean Field Approximations For Heterogeneous Systems: It Works!

This repository contains:

* the code to generate plots used in the paper
* the tex file and additional resources to compile the paper

To run all notebooks and generate the plots for the paper just run the makefile using the `make` command in the root directory of the repository. The generated plots are then saved into the folder `latex/plots`. Alternatively the notebooks can be run seperately and are located in the directories `notebooks and plots/caching` and `notebooks and plots/load_balancing`.
