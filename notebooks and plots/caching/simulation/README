### About ###

This program simulates the cache replacement policies and the
corresponding ODE approximation for the RAND(m) and FIFO(m) described
in the following paper:

### Compilation ###

Typing "make" should work

### Usage example ###

To simulate FIFO(m), RAND(m) and the ode approximation for 1000 items
that have a popularity distribtued according to a zipf distribution of
parameter 0.9 and a cache with 3 lists of sizes 10,20 and 30:

./simu N1000 a0.9 M10 20 30 F        > FIFO_10_20_30.txt
./simu N1000 a0.9 M10 20 30 R        > RANDOM_10_20_30.txt
./ode_solver N1000 a0.9 M10 20 30 R  > ode_10_20_30.txt


To plot the total popularities as a function of time:

echo 'plot "FIFO_10_20_30.txt" u 5,"RANDOM_10_20_30.txt" u 5,"ode_10_20_30.txt" u 5' | gnuplot


To plot the popularity in the middle box as a function of time:

echo 'plot "FIFO_10_20_30.txt" u 3,"RANDOM_10_20_30.txt" u 3,"ode_10_20_30.txt" u 3' | gnuplot
