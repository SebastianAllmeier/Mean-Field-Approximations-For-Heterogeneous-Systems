@article{albertEstimatingInfinitesimalGenerator1992,
	abstract = {Let \{Z(t),t{$>$}0\} be a separable, continuous time Markov Process with stationary transition probabilities Pij(t),i,j=1,2,{$\cdots$},M. Under suitable regularity conditions, the matrix of transition probabilities, P(t), can be expressed in the form P(t)=exptQ, where Q is an M\texttimes M matrix and is called the "infinitesimal generator" for the process. In this paper, a density on the space of sample functions over [0,t) is constructed. This density depends upon Q. If Q is unknown, the maximum likelihood estimate Q\^(k,t)={$\parallel$}q\^ij(k,t){$\parallel$}, based upon k independent realizations of the process over [0,t) can be derived. If each state has positive probability of being occupied during [0,t) and if the number of independent observations, k, grows larger (t held fixed), then q\^ij is strongly consistent and the joint distribution of the set \{k12(q\^ij-qij)\}i{$\neq$}j (suitably normalized), is asymptotically normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the identity matrix. If k is held fixed (at one, say) and if t grows large, then q\^ij is again strongly consistent and the joint distribution of the set \{t12(q\^ij-qij)\}i{$\neq$}j (suitably normalized), is asymptotically normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the identity matrix, provided that the process \{Z(t),t{$>$}0\} is positively regular. The asymptotic variances of the q\^ij are computed in both cases.},

	abstract = {The present lecture notes describe stochastic epidemic models and methods for their statistical analysis. Our aim is to present ideas for such models, and methods for their analysis; along the way we make practical use of several probabilistic and statistical techniques. This will be done without focusing on any specific disease, and instead rigorously analyzing rather simple models. The reader of these lecture notes could thus have a two-fold purpose in mind: to learn about epidemic models and their statistical analysis, and/or to learn and apply techniques in probability and statistics. The lecture notes require an early graduate level knowledge of probability and They introduce several techniques which might be new to students, but our statistics. intention is to present these keeping the technical level at a minlmum. Techniques that are explained and applied in the lecture notes are, for example: coupling, diffusion approximation, random graphs, likelihood theory for counting processes, martingales, the EM-algorithm and MCMC methods. The aim is to introduce and apply these techniques, thus hopefully motivating their further theoretical treatment. A few sections, mainly in Chapter 5, assume some knowledge of weak convergence; we hope that readers not familiar with this theory can understand the these parts at a heuristic level. The text is divided into two distinct but related parts: modelling and estimation.},

@article{baccelliPairReplicaMeanFieldLimitIntensitybased2020,
	abstract = {Replica-mean-field models have been proposed to decipher the activity of neural networks via a multiply-and-conquer approach. In this approach, one considers limit networks made of infinitely many replicas with the same basic neural structure as that of the network of interest, but exchanging spikes in a randomized manner. The key point is that these replica-mean-field networks are tractable versions that retain important features of the finite structure of interest. To date, the replica framework has been discussed for first-order models, whereby elementary replica constituents are single neurons with independent Poisson inputs. Here, we extend this replica framework to allow elementary replica constituents to be composite objects, namely, pairs of neurons. As they include pairwise interactions, these pair-replica models exhibit non-trivial dependencies in their stationary dynamics, which cannot be captured by first-order replica models. Our contributions are two-fold: \$(i)\$ We analytically characterize the stationary dynamics of a pair of intensity-based neurons with independent Poisson input. This analysis involves the reduction of a boundary-value problem related to a two-dimensional transport equation to a system of Fredholm integral equations---a result of independent interest. \$(ii)\$ We analyze the set of consistency equations determining the full network dynamics of certain replica limits. These limits are those for which replica constituents, be they single neurons or pairs of neurons, form a partition of the network of interest. Both analyses are numerically validated by computing input/output transfer functions for neuronal pairs and by computing the correlation structure of certain pair-dominated network dynamics.},

@article{baccelliReplicameanfieldLimitsIntensitybased2019,
	abstract = {Neural computations emerge from myriads of neuronal interactions occurring in intricate spiking networks. Due to the inherent complexity of neural models, relating the spiking activity of a network to its structure requires simplifying assumptions, such as considering models in the thermodynamic mean-field limit. In the thermodynamic mean-field limit, an infinite number of neurons interact via vanishingly small interactions, thereby erasing the finite size of interactions. To better capture the finite-size effects of interactions, we propose to analyze the activity of neural networks in the replica-mean-field limit. Replica-mean-field models are made of infinitely many replicas which interact according to the same basic structure as that of the finite network of interest. Here, we analytically characterize the stationary dynamics of an intensity-based neural network with spiking reset and heterogeneous excitatory synapses in the replica-mean-field limit. Specifically, we functionally characterize the stationary dynamics of these limit networks via ordinary differential equations derived from the Poisson Hypothesis of queuing theory. We then reduce this functional characterization to a system of self-consistency equations specifying the stationary neuronal firing rates. Of general applicability, our approach combines rate-conservation principles from point-process theory and analytical considerations from generating-function methods. We validate our approach by demonstrating numerically that replica-mean-field models better capture the dynamics of neural networks with large, sparse connections than their thermodynamic counterparts. Finally, we explain that improved performance by analyzing the neuronal rate-transfer functions, which saturate due to finite-size effects in the replica-mean-field limit.},

@article{beckElementaryProofConvergence2016,
	abstract = {The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model has been used extensively to model disease spread and other processes. Despite the widespread usage of this ordinary differential equation (ODE) based model which represents the mean-field approximation of the underlying stochastic SIR process on contact networks, only few rigorous approaches exist and these use complex semigroup and martingale techniques to prove that the expected fraction of the susceptible and infected nodes of the stochastic SIR process on a complete graph converges as the number of nodes increases to the solution of the mean-field ODE model. Extending the elementary proof of convergence for the SIS process introduced by Armbruster and Beck (2016) to the SIR process, we show convergence using only a system of three ODEs, simple probabilistic inequalities, and basic ODE theory. Our approach can also be generalized to many other types of compartmental models (e.g., susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS)) which are linear ODEs with the addition of quadratic terms for the number of new infections similar to the SI term in the SIR model.},

@article{benaimClassMeanField2008,
	abstract = {We consider models of N interacting objects, where the interaction is via a common resource and the distribution of states of all objects. We introduce the key scaling concept of intensity; informally, the expected number of transitions per object per time slot is of the order of the intensity. We consider the case of vanishing intensity, i.e.~the expected number of object transitions per time slot is o(N). We show that, under mild assumptions and for large N, the occupancy measure converges, in mean square (and thus in probability) over any finite horizon, to a deterministic dynamical system. The mild assumption is essentially that the coefficient of variation of the number of object transitions per time slot remains bounded with N. No independence assumption is needed anywhere. The convergence results allow us to derive properties valid in the stationary regime. We discuss when one can assure that a stationary point of the ODE is the large N limit of the stationary probability distribution of the state of one object for the system with N objects. We use this to develop a critique of the fixed point method sometimes used in conjunction with the decoupling assumption.},

	abstract = {We study the limiting behaviour of stochastic models of populations of interacting agents, as the number of agents goes to infinity. Classical mean-field results have established that this limiting behaviour is described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) under two conditions: (1) that the dynamics is smooth; and (2) that the population is composed of a finite number of homogeneous sub-populations, each containing a large number of agents. This paper reviews recent work showing what happens if these conditions do not hold. In these cases, it is still possible to exhibit a limiting regime at the price of replacing the ODE by a more complex dynamical system. In the case of non-smooth or uncertain dynamics, the limiting regime is given by a differential inclusion. In the case of multiple population scales, the ODE is replaced by a stochastic hybrid automaton.},

CPF is a subset of {$\pi$}-calculus, but is already more powerful that what is strictly needed to represent chemistry: it supports also parameterization and compositional reuse of models. The mapping of CPF to chemistry thus induces a parametric and compositional mapping of CPF to differential equations; the indirect mapping through chemistry is easier to define and understand than a direct mapping.

@article{chaintreauAgeGossipSpatial2009,
	abstract = {Disseminating a piece of information, or updates for a piece of information, has been shown to benefit greatly from simple randomized procedures, sometimes referred to as gossiping, or epidemic algorithms. Similarly, in a network where mobile nodes occasionally receive updated content from a base station, gossiping using opportunistic contacts allows for recent updates to be efficiently maintained, for a large number of nodes. In this case, however, gossiping depends on node mobility. For this reason, we introduce a new gossip model, with mobile nodes moving between different classes that can represent locations or states, which determine gossiping behavior of the nodes. Here we prove that, when the number of mobile nodes becomes large, the age of the latest updates received by mobile nodes approaches a deterministic mean-field regime. More precisely, we show that the occupancy measure of the process constructed, with the ages defined above, converges to a deterministic limit that can be entirely characterized by differential equations. This major simplification allows us to characterize how mobility, source inputs and gossiping influence the age distribution for low and high ages. It also leads to a scalable numerical evaluation of the performance of mobile update systems, which we validate (using a trace of 500 taxicabs) and use to propose infrastructure deployment.},

	abstract = {This paper aims at finding fundamental design principles for hierarchical web caching. An analytical modeling technique is developed to characterize an uncooperative two-level hierarchical caching system where the least recently used (LRU) algorithm is locally run at each cache. With this modeling technique, we are able to identify a characteristic time for each cache, which plays a fundamental role in understanding the caching processes. In particular, a cache can be viewed roughly as a lowpass filter with its cutoff frequency equal to the inverse of the characteristic time. Documents with access frequencies lower than this cutoff frequency will have good chances to pass through the cache without cache hits. This viewpoint enables us to take any branch of the cache tree as a tandem of lowpass filters at different cutoff frequencies, which further results in the finding of two fundamental design principles. Finally, to demonstrate how to use the principles to guide the caching algorithm design, we propose a cooperative hierarchical web caching architecture based on these principles. The simulation study shows that the proposed cooperative architecture results in 50\% saving of the cache resource compared with the traditional uncooperative hierarchical caching architecture.},

This includes sparse spikes deconvolution or training a neural network with a single hidden layer. For these problems, we study a simple minimization method: the unknown measure is discretized into a mixture of particles and a continuous-time gradient descent is performed on their weights and positions. This is an idealization of the usual way to train neural networks with a large hidden layer. We show that, when initialized correctly and in the many-particle limit, this gradient flow, although non-convex, converges to global minimizers. The proof involves Wasserstein gradient flows, a by-product of optimal transport theory. Numerical experiments show that this asymptotic behavior is already at play for a reasonable number of particles, even in high dimension.},

These processes mainly include the propagation of diseases, rumors and information on top of a given population. In the last two decades, with the advent of modern network science, we have witnessed significant advances in this field of research. Here we review the main theoretical and numerical methods developed for the study of spreading processes on complex networked systems. Specifically, we formally define epidemic processes on single and multilayer networks and discuss in detail the main methods used to perform numerical simulations. Throughout the review, we classify spreading processes (disease and rumor models) into two classes according to the nature of time: (i) continuous-time and (ii) cellular automata approach, where the second one can be further divided into synchronous and asynchronous updating schemes. Our revision includes the heterogeneous mean-field, the quenched-mean field, and the pair quenched mean field approaches, as well as their respective simulation techniques, emphasizing similarities and differences among the different techniques. The content presented here offers a whole suite of methods to study epidemic-like processes in complex networks, both for researchers without previous experience in the subject and for experts.},

For an \$m\$ hidden node shallow neural network with ReLU activation and \$n\$ training data, we show as long as \$m\$ is large enough and no two inputs are parallel, randomly initialized gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. Our analysis relies on the following observation: over-parameterization and random initialization jointly restrict every weight vector to be close to its initialization for all iterations, which allows us to exploit a strong convexity-like property to show that gradient descent converges at a global linear rate to the global optimum. We believe these insights are also useful in analyzing deep models and other first order methods.},

@article{EpidemiologyGeneticsCoevolution1983,
	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that parasites (interpreted broadly to include viruses, bacteria, protozoans and helminths) may influence the numerical magnitude or geographical distribution of their host populations; most of such studies focus on the population biology and epidemiology of the host-parasite association, taking no explicit account of the genetics. Other researchers have explored the possibility that the coevolution of hosts and parasites may be responsible for much of the genetic diversity found in natural populations, and may even be the main reason for sexual reproduction; such genetic studies rarely take accurate account of the density- and frequency-dependent effects associated with the transmission and maintenance of parasitic infections. This paper aims to combine epidemiology and genetics, reviewing the way in which earlier studies fit into a wider scheme and offering some new ideas about host-parasite coevolution. One central conclusion is that `successful' parasites need not necessarily evolve to be harmless: both theory and some empirical evidence (particularly from the myxoma-rabbit system) indicate that many coevolutionary paths are possible, depending on the relation between virulence and transmissibility of the parasite or pathogen.},

Global sensitivity analysis aims to identify the parameters whose uncertainty has the largest impact on the variability of a quantity of interest. One of the statistical tools used to quantify the influence of each input variable on the quantity of interest are the Sobol' sensitivity indices. In this paper, we consider stochastic models described by stochastic differential equations (SDE). We focus the study on mean quantities, defined as the expectation with respect to the Wiener measure of a quantity of interest related to the solution of the SDE itself. Our approach is based on a Feynman-Kac representation of the quantity of interest, from which we get a parametrized partial differential equation (PDE) representation of our initial problem. We then handle the uncertainty on the parametrized PDE using polynomial chaos expansion and a stochastic Galerkin projection.},

Recently it was shown that under very general conditions the steady-state expectation of any performance functional converges at rate O(1/N) to its mean field approximation. In this paper we establish a result that expresses the constant associated with this 1/N term. This constant can be computed easily as it is expressed in terms of the Jacobian and Hessian of the drift in the fixed point and the solution of a single Lyapunov equation. This allows us to propose a refined mean field approximation. By considering a variety of applications, that include coupon collector, load balancing and bin packing problems, we illustrate that the proposed refined mean field approximation is significantly more accurate that the classic mean field approximation for small and moderate values of N: relative errors are often below 1\% for systems with N=10.},

	abstract = {Abstract           As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation is depleted causing the rate at which new cases occur to decline. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are frailer, and therefore more susceptible or more exposed, have higher probabilities of being infected, depleting the susceptible subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection, and thus intensifying the deceleration in occurrence of new cases. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, herd immunity is attained. Although estimates vary, it is currently believed that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60\textendash 70\% of the population to be immune. Here we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection can reduce these estimates. Achieving accurate estimates of heterogeneity for SARS-CoV-2 is therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Since roughly a decade ago, network science has focused among others on the problem of how the spreading of diseases depends on structural patterns. Here, we contribute to further advance our understanding of epidemic spreading processes by proposing a non-perturbative formulation of the heterogeneous mean field approach that has been commonly used in the physics literature to deal with this kind of spreading phenomena. The non-perturbative equations we propose have no assumption about the proximity of the system to the epidemic threshold, nor any linear approximation of the dynamics. In particular, we first develop a probabilistic description at the node level of the epidemic propagation for the so-called susceptible-infected-susceptible family of models, and after we derive the corresponding heterogeneous mean-field approach. We propose to use the full extension of the approach instead of pruning the expansion to first order, which leads to a non-perturbative formulation that can be solved by fixed point iteration, and used with reliability far away from the epidemic threshold to assess the prevalence of the epidemics. Our results are in close agreement with Monte Carlo simulations thus enhancing the predictive power of the classical heterogeneous mean field approach, while providing a more effective framework in terms of computational time.},

We present finite-time performance bounds for the case where the learning rate is fixed. The key idea in obtaining these bounds is to use a Lyapunov function motivated by singular perturbation theory for linear differential equations. We use the bound to design an adaptive learning rate scheme which significantly improves the convergence rate over the known optimal polynomial decay rule in our experiments, and can be used to potentially improve the performance of any other schedule where the learning rate is changed at pre-determined time instants.},

@article{hairiScalingCalculableError2020,
	abstract = {This paper provides a recipe for deriving calculable approximation errors of mean-field models in heavy-traffic with the focus on the well-known load balancing algorithm -- power-of-two-choices (Po2). The recipe combines Stein's method for linearized mean-field models and State Space Concentration (SSC) based on geometric tail bounds. In particular, we divide the state space into two regions, a neighborhood near the mean-field equilibrium and the complement of that. We first use a tail bound to show that the steady-state probability being outside the neighborhood is small. Then, we use a linearized mean-field model and Stein's method to characterize the generator difference, which provides the dominant term of the approximation error. From the dominant term, we are able to obtain an asymptotically-tight bound and a nonasymptotic upper bound, both are calculable bounds, not order-wise scaling results like most results in the literature. Finally, we compared the theoretical bounds with numerical evaluations to show the effectiveness of our results. We note that the simulation results show that both bounds are valid even for small size systems such as a system with only ten servers.},

Further, the kind and level of sophistication of mathematics applied in various sciences has changed drastically in recent years: measure theory is used (non-trivially) in regional and theoretical economics; algebraic geometry interacts with physics; the Minkowsky lemma, coding theory and the structure of water meet one another in packing and covering theory; quantum fields, crystal defects and mathematical programming profit from homotopy theory; Lie algebras are relevant to filtering; and prediction and electrical engineering can use Stein spaces. And in addition to this there are such new emerging subdisciplines as "experimental mathematics", "CFD", "completely integrable systems", "chaos, synergetics and large-scale order", which are almost impossible to fit into the existing classification schemes.

The goal is to achieve a closed form of a large, usually even infinite, set of coupled differential (or difference) equations. Each equation describes the evolution of one ``moment'', a suitable coarse-grained quantity computable from the full state space. If the system is too large for analytical and/or numerical methods, then one aims to reduce it by finding a moment closure relation expressing ``higher-order moments'' in terms of ``lower-order moments''. In this brief review, we focus on highlighting how moment closure methods occur in different contexts.

	abstract = {Multi-layer neural networks are among the most powerful models in machine learning, yet the fundamental reasons for this success defy mathematical understanding. Learning a neural network requires to optimize a non-convex high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem which is usually attacked using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the first case, does this happen because local minima are absent, or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the second, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties? In this paper we consider a simple case, namely two-layers neural networks, and prove that -in a suitable scaling limit- SGD dynamics is captured by a certain non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call distributional dynamics (DD). We then consider several specific examples, and show how DD can be used to prove convergence of SGD to networks with nearly ideal generalization error. This description allows to 'average-out' some of the complexities of the landscape of neural networks, and can be used to prove a general convergence result for noisy SGD.},

Each customer chooses some constant d servers independently and uniformly at random from the n servers and waits for service at the one with the fewest customers. Customers are served according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol and the service time for a customer is exponentially distributed with mean 1. We call this problem the supermarket model. We wish to know how the system behaves and in particular we are interested in the effect that the parameter d has on expected time a customer spends in the system in equilibrium. Our approach uses a limiting, deterministic model representing the behavior as n 3 I to approximate the behavior of finite systems. The analysis of the deterministic model is interesting in its own right. Along with a theoretical justification of this approach, we provide simulations that demonstrate that the method accurately predicts system behavior, even for relatively small systems. Our analysis provides surprising implications: Having d  P choices leads to exponential improvements in the expected time a customer spends in the system over d  I, whereas having d  Q choices is only a constant factor better than d  P. We discuss the possible implications for system design.},

In particular we consider servers that use processor sharing but with different server rates and jobs are routed to the server with the smallest occupancy among a finite number of randomly selected servers. We focus on the case of two servers that is often referred to as a Power-of-Two scheme. We first show that in the heterogeneous setting there can be a loss in the stability region over the homogeneous case and thus such randomized schemes need not outperform static randomized schemes in terms of mean delay in opposition to the homogeneous case of equal server speeds where the stability region is maximal and coincides with that of static randomized routing. We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the server occupancies and show that the tail distribution of the server occupancy has a super-exponential behavior as in the homogeneous case as the number of servers goes to infinity. To overcome the stability issue, we show that it is possible to combine static state-independent scheme with randomized JSQ scheme that allows us to recover the maximal stability region combined with the benefits of JSQ and such a scheme is preferable in terms of average delay. The techniques are based on a mean field analysis where we show that the stationary distributions coincide with those obtained under asymptotic independence of the servers and moreover the stationary distributions are insensitive to the job size distribution.},

In particular, we focus on the classical power-of-two load balancing scheme and a variant of it in which a newly arrived job is assigned to the server having the least instantaneous Lagrange shadow cost among two randomly chosen servers. The instantaneous Lagrange shadow cost at a server is given by the ratio of the number of unfinished jobs at the server to the capacity of the server. Two different approaches of analysis are presented for each scheme. For exponential job length distribution, the analysis is done using the mean field approach and for more general job length distributions the analysis is carried out assuming an asymptotic independence property. Analytical expressions to compute mean sojourn time of jobs are found for both schemes. Asymptotic insensitivity of the schemes to the type of job length distribution is established. Numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical results and to show that, unlike the homogeneous scenario, the power-of-two type schemes considered in this paper may not always result in better behaviour in terms of the mean sojourn time of jobs.},

@article{sirignanoMeanFieldAnalysis2019,
	abstract = {Machine learning, and in particular neural network models, have revolutionized fields such as image, text, and speech recognition. Today, many important real-world applications in these areas are driven by neural networks. There are also growing applications in engineering, robotics, medicine, and finance. Despite their immense success in practice, there is limited mathematical understanding of neural networks. This paper illustrates how neural networks can be studied via stochastic analysis, and develops approaches for addressing some of the technical challenges which arise. We analyze one-layer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (A) large network sizes and (B) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously prove that the empirical distribution of the neural network parameters converges to the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This result can be considered a law of large numbers for neural networks. In addition, a consequence of our analysis is that the trained parameters of the neural network asymptotically become independent, a property which is commonly called "propagation of chaos".},

	abstract = {We study the fluid limit analysis of random replacement (RR) caching for the independent reference model. Applying the limit theorem for the mean field interaction model, we derive the fluid limit of fault probability in the transient state as well as in the steady state. Since the stationary fault probability for the RR cache is identical to that for the firstin first-out (FIFO) cache, our results on the stationary fault probability are available for the FIFO caching. We see that the fluid limit of stationary fault probability that we obtain is coincident with the existing heuristic approximation of stationary fault probability. That is, our fluid limit analysis gives a rigorous theoretical foundation to the heuristic approximation.},

@article{vanhoudtMeanFieldModel2013,
	abstract = {Garbage collection (GC) algorithms play a key role in reducing the write amplification in flash-based solid state drives, where the write amplification affects the lifespan and speed of the drive. This paper introduces a mean field model to assess the write amplification and the distribution of the number of valid pages per block for a class C of GC algorithms. Apart from the Random GC algorithm, class C includes two novel GC algorithms: the d-Choices GC algorithm, that selects d blocks uniformly at random and erases the block containing the least number of valid pages among the \$d\$ selected blocks, and the Random++ GC algorithm, that repeatedly selects another block uniformly at random until it finds a block with a lower than average number of valid blocks. Using simulation experiments we show that the proposed mean field model is highly accurate in predicting the write amplification (for drives with \$N=50000\$ blocks). We further show that the d-Choices GC algorithm has a write amplification close to that of the Greedy GC algorithm even for small d values, e.g., d = 10, and offers a more attractive trade-off between its simplicity and its performance than the Windowed GC algorithm introduced and analyzed in earlier studies. The Random++ algorithm is shown to be less effective as it is even inferior to the FIFO algorithm when the number of pages \$b\$ per block is large (e.g., for b {$\geq$} 64).},

@inproceedings{yingApproximationErrorMeanField2016,
	abstract = {Mean-field models have been used to study large-scale and complex stochastic systems, such as large-scale data centers and dense wireless networks, using simple deterministic models (dynamical systems). This paper analyzes the approximation error of mean-field models for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC), and focuses on mean-field models that are represented as finite-dimensional dynamical systems with a unique equilibrium point. By applying Stein's method and the perturbation theory, the paper shows that under some mild conditions, if the mean-field model is globally asymptotically stable and locally exponentially stable, the mean square difference between the stationary distribution of the stochastic system with size M and the equilibrium point of the corresponding mean-field system is O(1/M ). The result of this paper establishes a general theorem for establishing the convergence and the approximation error (i.e., the rate of convergence) of a large class of CTMCs to their mean-field limit by mainly looking into the stability of the mean-field model, which is a deterministic system and is often easier to analyze than the CTMCs. Two applications of mean-field models in data center networks are presented to demonstrate the novelty of our results.},
